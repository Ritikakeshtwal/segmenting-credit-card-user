# Credit Card Customers Segmentation (K-Means + PCA)

## 📌 Description
Segmentation of credit card customers using **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify distinct spending patterns and group customers based on their credit card usage behavior.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Standard Scaling**
- **Silhouette Score** for cluster validation

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Credit Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata)
- Contains anonymized data of credit card users, including spending amounts, bill amounts, and payment patterns.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritikakeshtwal/segmenting-credit-card-user.git
Navigate to the Project Folder

Copy code
cd credit-card-user-segmentation
Install Required Libraries

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Script

Copy code
python credit_card_segmentation.py
📊 Output
Elbow Method Graph → Helps choose optimal number of clusters.

Silhouette Score → Measures clustering quality.

2D PCA Scatter Plot → Visual representation of customer clusters.

📜 Project Workflow
Load dataset and explore basic info.
Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
Scale the data using StandardScaler.
Use Elbow Method to find optimal K.
Apply K-Means with chosen K.
Evaluate clustering using Silhouette Score.
Reduce dimensions with PCA for visualization.

Agar tum isko GitHub pe paste karoge to repo professional lagegi aur recruiters ya collaborators easily samajh paayenge project.  

Kya tum chahte ho main tumhare code ko bhi isi README ke saath ek **GitHub-ready folder format** me bana du?  
Isse tum seedha upload kar paoge.
